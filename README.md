> A step-by-step guide for everyone in getting started their open-source journey.

Many beginners (developers or non-developers) find it challenging to contribute to open source projects. They may feel that they are not skilled enough or that they don't know how to get involved. However, this is not true. Anyone can contribute to open source, regardless of their level of expertise. The key is to how a learning and helping others mindset, following the best practices and follow the specific guidelines of each project.

This repository provides a basic roadmap for anyone who wants to start their open source journey from scratch. It covers the essential steps and tools that you need to become a successful open source contributor.

## What is Open Source?
The term [open source](https://opensource.org/osd/) means that anyone can see, understand, learn, modify or distribute (depending upon the [license](https://opensource.org/licenses/)) the source code of the software. The amazing technology that we using now a days become possible due to the rise of open source movement.

The source code of:
- [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)
- [Blender](https://github.com/blender/blender)
- [Android](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main)
- [Firefox](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source)
- [Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git)
- [Apache HTTP Server](https://github.com/apache/httpd)
- [MySQL](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server)
- [Git](https://github.com/git/git)
- [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
- [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
- [VsCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium)
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/source/)
- [VLC](https://github.com/videolan/vlc)
- [InkScape](https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape)
- [FFmpeg](https://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git)
- [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes)
- [Docker](https://github.com/moby/moby)
- [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo)
- [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot)
- [Krita](https://github.com/KDE/krita)
- Almost all the programming languages

And even many machine learning models like [Meta LLAMA 2](https://ai.meta.com/llama) and OpenAi's general-purpose speech recognition model [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) are open source. Also, there are some open source [games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_video_games) like [Doom](https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM). All of these are open source projects. You can see their source code, learn from them, modify them, and even contribute to them. You can also use them in your own projects. This is the power of open source.

### Main philosophy of Open Source
The main philosophy of open-source products is the freedom to think, create, learn, and share. It is a collaborative effort of many developers who are working together to create something amazing. In the early phases of technology, open source helps the technology to not become handicapped by some big entities and is developed by people who really have the passion to make that piece of technology better.

## Benefits of Contributing in Open Source
As a complete beginner in technology we face a common problem that we are unable to make our hands dirty on the products or softwares that we uses in our daily life and the softwares that powers the whole world. Here, open source solves the problem.

By working in open source project you
- Understand the magic behind the amazing technology.
- Improve your skills by working with other developers.
- Work and learn from the best developers and technology.
- Making an impact on the world by contributing to the projects that was used by millions.
- Open your door to the world of opportunities.
- Learn people skills like communication, teamwork, leadership, etc.
- Work on the thing that you are passionate about.
- Getting paid (as a job or through some programs)

If you want to know that open source is for you or not, then ask these questions to yourself:
- Do you want become a technology maker?
- Do you want to grow your network?
- Do you like improving the technology that you uses in your daily life.
- Building a community?

## Find your Passion
You will be much more successful if you work on your passion. Therefore, the first is that we have to find our passion.

- The thing which you like to do in your free time.
- Which thing excites you the most?
- The thing which you do without any external or monetary motivation. 
- Where are you seeing yourself in next 2-3 years.
- Find the intersection of your passion and your technology.

For some people it's like gaming or art, or poetry which they love to do in their free. For example, if you like art then you can contribute to the artisitic softwares like blender, inkscape, gimp, openshot, krita. This way you can improve your skills, learn from the best developers and make an impact on the world.

## Find a project to contribute
Now, you have identified your passion. The next step is to find a project to contribute. Selecting a project is one of the crucial step in your open source journey.

> Identify the project that you uses in your daily life. This is the best way to find a project to contribute. As you have the passion for that project and you know the pain features that you want to add or improve in that project. 

- One of the easiest way to find the project and the welcoming community is using Google Summer Of Code [website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/organizations).
    - Just go there, and search for the term that you are passionte about you will find organizations the work on that technology.

## How to understand Large and Complex Codebases
Understanding the code which was developed by experienced developers over a long period of time is a challenging task. Therefore, don't expect the code by just looking at it. You have to understand the codebase in a systematic way. These are the steps that you can follow to understand the codebase.

- Read the documentation.
- Don't dive into the codebase without any purpose.
- Atleast know the basics of the programming language.
- Read the theoritcal aspect of the project.
- Find a specfic task that you want to do and then ask or find which part of the codebase is responsible for that task.
- Use the debugger to understand the codebase.
- Use the search feature of the codebase to find the specific code.
- Use `git blame`` to find the author or context of the code.

## Don't hesistate to help others
- Open source is all about learning and helping others. If you find a beginner who is struggling with the same problem that you have faced in the past then don't hesistate to help them. Motivate and refer them to the right resources. This way you can also improve your skills and build a network.

## Document your journey
Documenting your journey is the best to help others or maybe your future self in understanding the process that you have followed. You can document your journey in the form of a blog, video, or a GitHub repository. Documenting your joureny through blog is the easiest way to get started. You can use
