# Google Summer of Code (GSoC) Mentorship Program

Do you have a passion for working on open-source projects that power the whole world and a desire to learn from cutting-edge technologies? Do you want to work on these amazing projects while sitting at home and receiving a stipend between $1500 and $3000? If your answer is a resounding “yes,” then Google Summer of Code (GSoC) might just be the perfect journey for you!

In the past, Google Summer of Code was available only to students enrolled in educational institutions. Now, it's open to anyone with a passion for understanding how technologies used in our daily lives work.

Before you start reading, here’s a little about me. I was a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) student for the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) in both 2023 and 2024. Everything I share in this blog comes from my own experience and helped me get selected — so I’m confident it can help you too. If you need any guidance or want to see my accepted proposals, feel free to reach out to me on <https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmahad/>

## What is GSoC?

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an online program by Google that connects contributors with open-source organizations. Participants can apply to work on specific projects with organizations during the program period. They receive guidance and feedback from experienced mentors, as well as a stipend and certification from Google. There are three project sizes—small (90 hours), medium (175 hours), and large (350 hours)—depending on your skills and the project's complexity.

Some well-known organizations that take part in Google Summer Of Code are: GNU GCC, GNOME, Git, Wikimedia Foundation, Ruby, CNCF, Eclipse Foundation, Blender Foundation, Chromium, Django Software Foundation, R Language, Python Foundation, Apache Software Foundation, and TensorFlow, etc.

One of the important tips that really helps in cracking GSoC is **"start as early as you can"**.

## How GSoC Works?

We'll understand this by looking at the GSoC'25 timeline:

1. Open source software projects apply to be mentor organizations.
1. Google chooses the organizations to participate (195 in 2024).
1. Contributors submit project proposals to mentor organizations.
1. Mentor organizations choose the contributors they’d like to accept.
1. Coding begins! Contributors work on their project under the guidance of their mentor over 12 weeks (possible extensions available).
1. Contributors are paired with a mentor to help them throughout their project.
    - Community bonding period with orgs.
    - Midterm evaluation deadline (standard coding period).
    - Mentors submit final GSoC contributor evaluations (standard coding period).

## Eligibility Criteria

- Over 18 at the time of registration.
- Beginner open-source contributor or a student.
- Eligible to work in the country where you will reside during the coding period.
- Not a resident of a US-embargoed country.
- Not previously accepted into GSoC more than once (a person can be a GSoC contributor only twice).

## Benefits & Why Should I Apply

GSoC is a place where you not only apply your skills but also acquire many new ones. The learning is not limited to technical knowledge; GSoC introduces you to a new paradigm of collaborative coding. It is a platform to build on your current skills and hone them. There is a project for all skill levels at GSoC!

Here are some of the interesting benefits:

- Getting an edge when applying for a job at Google.
- An amazing stipend (between $1500 and $3000) and increased confidence.
- Being mentored by highly experienced developers.
- Your springboard to the open-source world.
- Building your network and getting involved.
- A sense of achievement.
- Enhancing your developer skills.
- Lastly, an absolutely amazing learning experience.

## Skills Required

Do you have some programming experience and are comfortable in at least one or two programming languages? Then, yes, you are good enough! No, you don’t need to be a Computer Science or IT major or have been coding for 5 years. Have work experience programming but spend your time studying philosophy? Yes, you are good enough to be a GSoC contributor!

Every project has different criteria for selecting GSoC contributors and subsequently different skill level requirements. If you meet the below list of general skills you are likely to find a GSoC project to which you can feel comfortable applying.

### The soft skills

- You find out where to go for help with technical questions.
- You take and respond well to feedback.
- You can work independently.
- You know when to ask questions.
- You can communicate effectively.

> Note: If you are not interested in the developer side, then you can also look for the Google Summer Of Docs program, which is specifically tailored for technical writing people.

### The Technical skills

- You can install and configure software packages on your own.
- You have access to a functioning computer.
- You’ve got experience using the programming language and operating system of the project.

**Pro Tip:** Read the organization’s requirements or skills they are looking for in potential GSoC Contributors.

# Let's Start the Journey

## Making First Contact

Interacting with an open-source group is sort of like walking in on a party where it seems like everyone else knows each other. People are discussing topics you may be interested in, or sometimes they could be discussing topics you neither know nor care about.

If you’re the type of person that would walk right up and introduce yourself at a party, then the best approach to getting started is to do what you’d do in real life. Contact the project, introduce yourself and ask questions related to your project.

- Join both the development and user mailing lists and spend a few days just reading the conversations.
- Read the mailing list archives.
- Introduce yourself! If you are new to the community you need to let people know who you are and why you are interested in contributing to the project.
- Ask questions. You should be able to come up with at least a few legitimate questions before offering your opinion on the right way to do things.
- Be humble.
- Don’t be intimidated. Don’t let a bad experience stop you from getting involved. Just relax and think about why you were snubbed and if there’s anything that you should be careful about before participating in another conversation.

## Choosing an Organization

For choosing an organization you need to find your passion.

Ask yourself:

- What skills do you currently possess or wish to acquire?
- Which open-source organizations align with your interests or curiosity?
- What type of project excites you the most?

You can explore keywords or topics that pique your curiosity on the internet or social media platforms. Additionally, joining online forums or chat groups related to open source or specific technologies can provide valuable insights from fellow enthusiasts.

Once you’ve pinpointed your interests, it’s time to find open-source organizations that resonate with you. Search the specific technologies on the GSoC page, here: <https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/organizations>

## Writing a Proposal

Some tips for writing the proposal:

- See previous accepted proposals.
- Contact the relevant organization before writing the proposal.
- Some organizations have a proposal template, which you can follow to add your information.
- Communicate with the mentors for help in writing and reviewing the proposal.

### Sample Outline for Writing Proposal

- Name and Contact Information
- Title
- Synopsis
  - If the format allows, start your proposal with a short summary, designed to convince the reviewer to read the rest of the proposal.
- Benefits to Community
- Deliverables
- Related Work
- Biographical Information
- Follow the rules defined by that organization.

## Being Turned Down

You’ve done your homework, found an exciting project, and you’ve written the best proposal you could. And you didn’t get into GSoC.

### What to do now?

First, don’t take it personally. Just like when you apply for a job, there are reasons why you might not get in, some that have nothing to do with you. Mentors may not be available, the organization may not have enough space for your project or it may just not be the right time for your proposal.

- Stay connected.
- Try a new organization.

#### Ask for feedback on your proposal

Some example questions to politely ask if your proposal is turned down include:

- Was there a mismatch with my skills and the project requirements? If so, what skill areas can I work on to be better qualified next year?
- Did I engage enough with the community during the application process?
- Do you have any suggestions on how to improve my pre-application communication?
- Was my project plan clear? Do you have any suggestions on how I can better communicate my ideas via the project plan next year?

#### Approach an organization about doing the project anyway

For those GSoC contributors with the drive to forge ahead without GSoC financial support, you may find that a community really is interested in your project anyway. Don’t be afraid to approach your community, GSoC org admin or mentors you communicated with about future contributions.

Perhaps you can work on a smaller portion of your idea over a longer period of time on your own, or find another project better suited.

#### Keep trying

Just keep trying. The next proposal just might be accepted…

“Never give up. It took me 3 years and 12 proposals to finally get into the program. If none of your proposals gets accepted, sit back and relax. You have a whole year ahead to improve your role with the open-source community by writing more code.”
